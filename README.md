## Overview and Origin
This case study involves the use case for AI that is currently in use and evolving for the benefit of cancer treatments for a large health care organization- LabCorp.

Labcorp (Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings), rebranded 1998 from Roche BioMedical (founded 1978) , has been an established clinical laboratory network around the world.It is headquartered in Burlington, NC and process approximately 2.5 million lab tests\ &nbsp;

Labcorp is the pioneer of genomic testing using PCR (polymerase chain reaction)technology, with growing maturity and organic growth, the company then spearheaded into molecular diagnosis, oncology testing, HIV testing. Its now a $16 billion company, and now operates in 3 major segments of Diagnostics, Clinical Trials and Contract Research Organization ( CRO’s), It played a major national role during covid-19 diagnostics and testing of the different mutations of the H1N1 virus,Its acquisition of Covance has led to forefront discovery of latest technologies in clinical trials for vaccines. &nbsp;
\&nbsp;
The company is heavily invested to solve the cancer crisis, and is making strides using AI technology for Cell and gene therapy to address and remediate the deficiency cells that are leading cause of cancer. Using AI technology, pgd with a liquid biopsy test that identifies circulating tumor cells or in a patient's bloodstream and then sequences the DNA to identify the mutation of cancer,it is trying to offer the best drug prescribed to cancer patients.[^5]

## Business Activities
Labcorp currently maintains and is expanding market leadership in bio pharma laboratory services , the central laboratory services for clinical trials and early development also for clinical trials. Central laboratory services are by far the # 1 laboratory in the diagnostics industry, and, early development research laboratories is #2 in the industry behind #1 other company called Charles River, and is continuing to grow in these 2 segments and maintain to maintain market leadership &nbsp;

LabCorp enjoys and leads in the development licensing and scaling of specialty testing, which has uniquely positioned and established leadership in the capabilities of gene therapy. A multitude of approaches that are being investigated around cell therapies, and All 6 of the FDA approved T cell therapy have been approved in the last 6 years and more importantly the breakthrough autologous cell therapy \

The patient's own cells are removed from the body, then the specific T- cells are isolated, they're sent off to a laboratory where they're modified and the primary antigen receptor or car, Is put onto those T- cells, there's an extended and manufacturers and a whole host of analytical tests needs to be done. Before they're delivered back to the patient and can only go back into that individual patient, That car on the T cell now, Homes goes around through the patient's body and looks for piece on the tumor that it can now recognize with the car when it finds that tumor cell, it attaches. And causes that cell to die so it's really quite distinct from other types of medicine. The most prevalent today is viral mediated gene therapy, And all of them, most of them in, especially the approved products are for rare diseases. There are more than 6,000 identified rare diseases And they impact over 300 Million people, cumulatively around the globe. Because most of them are caused by a single mutation in 1, gene of that. Patient and the gene therapy then aims to add delete or correct those underlying genetic mutations \

You have to have very strict chain of custody chain of identity. some of the viral vectors, Can go into and cause immunogenicity. So it's like any other virus even if you take out all the bad parts on the inside of the virus. To put the gene that you want, the outside of the virus is still needed to get the. To get the gene where you want it to go, is it the muscle or the liver or the heart or the eye \

It can cause the body to react to it as a foreign substance. So, using AI being used, and ML computer modeling.it helps to identify those proteins on the virus, also help find ones that will be less than the agnogenic. In the body, and so they do these testing with some AI algorithms and then can select the best ones. Also these AI models are tested To go into animal models, so you can use less the animal testing. &nbsp;
The idea that you could extract the patient cells, Modify them, put them back in the patient and it attacks cancer in a way that you permanently cure that patient because they continue to replicate that same cell, So, they've got that cancer fighting capability for the rest of their life. The genetic, broken genetic code of a patient out of the nucleus of a cell edit the DNA. To fix the mutation, put it inside of a virus. In fact, the patient with a virus that has the fixed DNA. Which then infuses that DNA in their selves in a way that they continue to replicate that DNA for the rest of their life  \

&nbsp;
While the industry have been around for 40+ years, the truly transformative products came into market from 2017. Ongoing clinical trials across an array of therapeutic indications and there are more than 2700 developers making these products across the globe. The United States, China and Japan and South Korea are leading the way &nbsp;
While there are slew of companies working on this field, the major breakthroughs have happened from the following companies.

Major breakthroughs along with therapies, it has identified carriers of a mutation in a gene that causes a disease called spinal muscular atrophy. Patients diagnosed with FMA and pass away before the age of 2, which is unfortunately very typical, challenges include impairment of their ability to move talk, swallow and eventually breathe. Application of AI modeled gene therapy to any neuromuscular disease genetic therapy for missing SMS gene has helped Babies with FMA supplement wi8th missing a gene vital for development through a 1-time injection. Gene therapy replaces this missing gene. \

LabCorp and Quest enjoy enviable positions at the top of the highly fragmented U.S. diagnostic testing market. Similarly sized, we believe they enjoy similar scale-related advantages in that market that give them both narrow moats, according to Morningstar's Equity Research Group. LabCorp and Quest operate with slightly different concentration risks and leverage targets, but those factors largely offset thier methodology. Specifically, LabCorp's contract research services that were acquired through Covance and Chiltern make it slightly larger and more diverse than Quest. However, Quest manages its balance sheet in a more conservative fashion. Those offsetting factors contribute to very similar credit risks at each firm, and although we see event risk potential on the horizon  \


According to LabCorp estimates, the U.S. clinical testing market generates about $80 billion in revenue annually. Quest estimates that 37% of the industry is generated from hospital patients (inpatient and outpatient), Analysts view as unlikely to be outsourced to commercial labs, while 63% is generated from non-hospital patients. Using this broad lens, Quest ($12.8 billion in 2023 diagnostic testing revenue) and LabCorp ($16.3 billion in 2017 diagnostic testing revenue) account for about 18% of the total industry on a cumulative basis.) \


"LabCorp's narrow moat is based on its vast national infrastructure, which translates into a considerable scale advantage over smaller regional labs in the independent diagnostic testing industry. With 50 primary testing labs and 1,750 patient-service centers across the United States, LabCorp is able to run tests on 470,000 specimens each day at a substantially lower cost than most of the hospitals, doctors' offices, and smaller independent labs that populate the market. LabCorp's ability to accommodate higher throughput and its extensive use of automation affords the firm a much lower cost structure-- significantly lower than that of hospitals and smaller independent labs. This advantage also means LabCorp's model is characterized by substantial operating leverage. This operating leverage has worked against the firm in the wake of the recession when healthcare utilization fell down. However, as utilization has returned to growth, LabCorp has also benefited (though the addition of the CRO business has pressured margins). \


Covance(an acquisition company of LabCorp) has a narrow moat in its own right. For contract research organizations, the moatiest part of the business is in late-stage clinical trials, where global infrastructure is critical and not easily replicated. The legacy Covance business also benefits from intangible assets, including expertise with local country cultures, regulatory agencies, and changing regulations, research design, data analytics, knowledge of key disease states, and close relationships with pharmaceutical and biotech clients. The clinical trials business now can tap into LabCorp's enormous patient database in order to better match eligible patients with appropriate trials and reduce enrollment time. This capability gives LabCorp an advantage over the competitive CROs. \


Quest enjoys a narrow moat as part of the duopoly that dominates the independent reference lab market. Compared with hospital-based labs and smaller regional players, Quest typically offers significant cost advantages thanks to its scale and volume. For example, tests at hospital labs typically cost 3 times more, on average, than the same test at Quest. This advantage becomes most evident when throughput increases and translates into high operating leverage. Additionally, the firm's nationwide footprint with an extensive network of patient service centers and in-physician office services would be difficult to replicate from scratch. Quest's advantageous cost structure and national coverage are also appealing to the payers that structure reimbursement and policies to funnel patients to the large independent labs. Payers would typically rather negotiate with the largest reference labs, including Quest, that provide the best geographic coverage for the insured base instead of cobbling together market-by-market coverage through multiple, smaller regional labs. Finally, Quest's scale and reach make it an attractive partner for the researchers who invent various diagnostic tests but have no distribution channels through which to sell the tests [^3]\

## Recommendations
For therapies that aim to harness the immune system to target specific cancer cells or pathogens (such as mRNA-based vaccines or CAR T-cell therapies), AI and ML can be used to predict tumor epitopes that could be bound by the therapeutic molecule. For CAR T-cell therapies, for example, AI and ML can be used to facilitate the identification of appropriate antigens and binding sites, thereby enabling the design of CARs that have improved on-target activity and minimal cytotoxicity.[^1] 


Algorithms that predict protein structure (such as the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database and system) can be used to model how patient-specific mutations affect protein structure and thus CAR binding. Newer functional foundation models (such as ProteinBERT) go beyond the structure to estimate these functional properties of interest directly.5 Once a set of possible candidates has been identified, AI and ML can be used to facilitate mass in silico screening of thousands of CAR constructs to identify candidates with high tumor-specific binding affinity and concomitant ability to activate the immune system.
Similar techniques are relevant to construct personalized mRNA- or DNA-based cancer vaccines. They identify the antigens of an individual’s tumor that could solicit the desired immune system response (for example, through epitope prediction). Spatial transcriptomics—visualizing gene expression at different tumor locations at a single-cell resolution—brings a spatial dimension to these efforts, facilitating the understanding of interactions among cell subtypes to find novel targets for cancer therapy discovery.


 Delivery vehicle design could similarly be part of an AI-enabled closed-loop research system. For instance, AI and ML could be used in vehicle design to increase AAV capsids’6 tissue specificity, load capacity, and stability:

>•	It first Started with millions of mutated DNA-encoded capsid designs, computing structures, and features, as well as from resulting mRNA and protein. \
>•	Analyzed for high-throughput measurement of the experimental capsid properties. \
>•	retrofit the measurements to the original design space to improve the capsid designs
>
A similar concept applies to lipid nanoparticles, although the backbone is chemistry based and exploring the relevant design space is exponentially harder.The development of chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) processes for these novel pharma modalities might be particularly well suited to an in silico process development approach, given the modalities’ platform-like nature and the relative independence of each molecule design. This approach encompasses the virtual design of production methods and equipment (instead of extensive lab optimization and screening experiments) to optimize production processes using a digital twin. The digital twin is built using a mechanistic model of each process step and complemented by statistical models based on previous process runs to reduce development costs, enable rapid scale-up and minimal tech transfer, and accelerate time to market.
